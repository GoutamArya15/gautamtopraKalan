# 🚀 Welcome to My Portfolio Repository 😎

Hey there, curious human 👋 or maybe a bot 🤖 (hi Skynet)!

This is my **personal portfolio** where I show off my coding powers ⚡, 
design vibes 🎨, and the magic of turning `coffee ☕ + code 💻` into websites 🌐.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
- 🔥 Code wizard in training  
- 🍕 Pizza-driven developer  
- 🕹️ Debugging is my cardio  
- 💡 I believe `console.log()` is a lifestyle

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Here’s the stuff I break... I mean **build** things with:

- ⚡ JavaScript / React  
- 🎯 PHP / Laravel  
- 🐘 MySQL (sometimes forgets the password 🙃)  
- 🎨 TailwindCSS / Bootstrap  
- 🛠️ Git & GitHub (pushing code since forever)

## 📂 What's Inside?
- `src/` → where the chaos begins 🌀  
- `public/` → where the browser parties 🎉  
- `package.json` → my relationship status with npm 📦  

---

## 🤓 Fun Facts
- Once I fixed a bug by **commenting out the whole code** 🤯  
- I drink more chai ☕ than the average developer  
- I believe in **CTRL + Z supremacy** 🔄
